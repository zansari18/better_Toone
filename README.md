# better_Toone
A program that connects to your spotify and gives you a movie based on your recently listened.
I formally apologize to whoever read the original README. 

To run:
Make sure you have a .env file with your own Spotify API key 
Run get_spot_token.py
1.) It should open your local host and display a message with Flask that says "Your token is printed in the console!"
2.) Go back to your terminal and press Ctrl + C to get your token
3.) Copy the given token

Run main.py
Paste your Spotify token
